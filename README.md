# Welcome

### Here is a little bit about me
I am a final year student at the University of Nottingham
Ducks are cool

## Recent projects
I'm currently working on a games library to digitize board games I like to play. A lot of word based games and puzzles use a lot of paper when playing - on a mobile device that isn't a problem.
Where am I now? Funny you should ask, I have a server that I wrote in .Net core that manages everything. I used SignalR to allow for real time communication between devices.
The server can serve up web pages but I am currently learning to create an app with Flutter.

## What's next
I am going to be working on a final year project where I will be building a platform to aid people in their use of self help resources.

### The premise
Imagine this...
Things are not going your way today - again! You know you found a resource last time that helped give you that all important boost you needed - but you just can't remember what it was. 
What if you could visit an app, say what you are doing and how you are feeling and get provided with a list of things that have helped you when you faced a similar situation before.
No more trawling through endless web pages, lists and apps to find the thing, now just open this one app to unlock the door to hapiness.
When you find a new resource that helps you will have to go and log it along with what you were doing that the resource helped with and how you were feeling at the time.
When you next feel the platform will offer up these as suggestions picking the best options for a variety of factors.
