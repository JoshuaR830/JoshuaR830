# Welcome

### Here is a little bit about me
- I am a Junior Software Engineer
- Ducks are cool
- I have a marmot called Wilbur - he loves all kinds of mischief and adventures!

## Recent projects
### Wilbur's adventures
I've recently built an app which is available on Google Play called Wilbur's Adventures.
I created the app in Flutter and the backend using API Gateway, AWS Lambda, DyanmoDB and S3. 

### Five Ways to Wellbeing
I built an Android app for my final year project which helps people to keep records of their activities and helps to identify how these fit into categories that could affect their mental wellbeing. Suggestions will then be made to help people to achieve more of the ways to wellbeing.
